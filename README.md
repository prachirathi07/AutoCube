# 🤖 AutoCube
📖 Overview
AutoCube is an advanced reinforcement learning model built to autonomously solve a Rubik’s Cube with a focus on optimizing the number of moves required. The model applies reinforcement learning techniques to refine its decision-making strategies, achieving up to 80% efficiency in move optimization. This project showcases the power of reinforcement learning in solving complex puzzles and accelerating training performance.

## 💡 Problem Statement
Solving a Rubik’s Cube optimally requires a strategic approach that minimizes the number of moves. Traditional methods can be inefficient or take too long to converge on the solution. AutoCube aims to develop a reinforcement learning model that not only solves the cube but does so with optimized decision-making and faster training times.
